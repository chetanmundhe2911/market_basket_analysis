You are using Dask inside AWS SageMaker JupyterLab and want to view the Dask Dashboard. You tried port forwarding with a token URL but it did not work.



http://localhost:8787/status
However, AWS SageMaker doesn't natively expose arbitrary ports like 8787, so you must work around that using Jupyter's dask_labextension.

ðŸ§° Recommended Approach: Use dask-labextension in SageMaker JupyterLab
AWS SageMaker JupyterLab supports Jupyter extensions such as dask-labextension, which allows access to the dashboard inside the notebook interface.

âœ… Steps:
Activate Dask Labextension
In a SageMaker JupyterLab terminal or cell, install it (if not already):

pip install dask-labextension --quiet
jupyter lab build
Note: jupyter lab build can take some time. If the kernel times out, try running it from a terminal in JupyterLab. 



python
```
from dask.distributed import Client, LocalCluster
```

# Create a local cluster with dashboard on port 8787
cluster = LocalCluster()
client = Client(cluster)

client
Running the above code cell should show a dashboard link inline in the notebook, like:

Dask Dashboard: [link] 

Clicking on this should work without needing to port forward.

Use the Dask Dashboard Pane in JupyterLab
There should be a Dask icon in the left pane (after installing dask-labextension). You can see task streams, progress bars, etc., directly within JupyterLab.


If you're running Dask in a SageMaker Studio Kernel App (or notebook instance) and want to expose the dashboard port:

SSH/port-forwarding is not directly supported in SageMaker Studio, so you'd need to have a workaround, such as:
Using EC2 (not SageMaker) 
Or setting up an SSH tunnel via SageMaker notebook instance (not Studio)
However , for SageMaker Studio, direct port forwarding (as in port 8787) does not work easily due to its way of routing traffic through the Jupyter server kernel gateway. Use the Jupyter Lab Extensions instead.
